todo
- Check for the existence of a an existing module by the same name
- Check for content that needs plugins, such as H5P, WW problem embed, etc




- Who should see the Clone Module button?
  - Only logged in users
  - Only users who belong to one or more sites with openlab-modules enabled? Or do we want to show to anyone, and then inform them *in the modal* that they need to have an openlab-modules site? This might be better for visibility and education
  - Limit by user type?
